        <h3>My name is omar</h3>
        <p>
          I like to keep my self busy doing coding & love to do math,secrifice,compromise and addjust. I don't have
          an amazing figure or a flat stomach. I'm far from being considered a model,but I am me. I eat food. I
          have curves. I have more fat than I should. I have scars because I have a history. Some people love
          me,some like me,some hate me. I have done good. I have done bad. I love my PJ's . I'm random and crazy. I
          don't pretend to be someone I'm not. I am who I am,you can love me or not. I won't change! And if I love
          you, I do it with all my heart!! I make no apologies for the way I am. I dare you to put this on your
          status if your proud of who you are !
        </p>

            <h1>My Dream is  <span class="orange">To become a Webdeveloper</span>!</h1>
            
            <p>
                As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.
