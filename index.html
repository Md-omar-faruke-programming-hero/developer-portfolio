        <h3>My name is omar</h3>
        <p>
          I like to keep my self busy doing coding & love to do math,secrifice,compromise and addjust. I don't have
          an amazing figure or a flat stomach. I'm far from being considered a model,but I am me. I eat food. I
          have curves. I have more fat than I should. I have scars because I have a history. Some people love
          me,some like me,some hate me. I have done good. I have done bad. I love my PJ's . I'm random and crazy. I
          don't pretend to be someone I'm not. I am who I am,you can love me or not. I won't change! And if I love
          you, I do it with all my heart!! I make no apologies for the way I am. I dare you to put this on your
          status if your proud of who you are !
        </p>
